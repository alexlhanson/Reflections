How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Viewing the differences between the two versions helped me to realize where the bug was at.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	You could then see how things were changing over time, and why certain components were added at different times.  Especially, if things were modified for another aspect of the program

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	The version allows there to be specific increments which might be associated with groups of changes and it can be logical.
	Also you can go back to a specific increment if a bug arose.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because the program may pull from multiple files at once whereas the Google Docs are all independant of each other.
	Having logical changes that effect multiple files should be connected in the diff.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    using gitbash terminal first the git log and then git diff command with first id and second id. 
    IDs are in the log and scroll using down and up arrow.  Also, right click selected text to copy and paste.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can always go back to a version that worked better or compare the changes to see where it got broken.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To finish this course and use version control methods with trying to make either the concept map of the Writings or Prayer Book app.
