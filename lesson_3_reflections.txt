When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I wish to collaborate with others or to access my work from multiple locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If there had been changes to a local files that would be erased if I automaticaly pulled the repository to overwrite it.
