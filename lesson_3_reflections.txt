When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I wish to collaborate with others or to access my work from multiple locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If there had been changes to a local files that would be erased if I automaticaly pulled the repository to overwrite it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Branches are a series of commits which stem from a place in the master code.
	Clones are a copy of a repository.
	Forks are clones from one Github account to another.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	If there are changes between the last known state stored locally I can either use it to see differences between my own current local commits or to merge it with my current state.
	It may also be I have a branch to merge it with locally that is not on the hub.
